### General Setup and Format

-   Your project must be created in an IntelliJ project called  `Summative-2-Lastname-Firstname`.
    
-   Initialize the project using  `start.spring.io`  using project options as demonstrated previously in class:
    
    -   Project:  `Maven`
        
    -   Language:  `Java`
        
    -   Spring Boot: Pick the latest version of 2.x.x.
        
    -   Project Metadata:
        
    -   Group:  `com.company`
        
    -   Artifact:  `bookstore`
        
        **NOTE**
        
        Setting the Artifact value will automatically update the values for Name and Package Name.
        
    -   Packaging:  `Jar`
        
    -   Java:  `11`
        
    -   Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and Spring for GraphQL.
        
-   Your project must have a series of tests using MockMvc.
    
-   Your project must use the existing  `book_store`  database.
    
-   Your REST API must accept and return data in JSON format where appropriate.
    
-   Your REST API must be documented using Swagger.
    
    -   Save the  `.yaml`  file in the root of the project directory.

## Bookstore REST API

Your project must be based on the existing  `book_store`  database. The script to create the  `book_store`  database is provided.
